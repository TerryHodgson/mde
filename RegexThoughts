Equations to be Identified

y=...

A*sin(x...) + D

sin(x...)/A + D

(1/A)


Solve the problem by adding a check between the ampersands for a A` so we can look for

(A/78787)*sin(B*C)&/d& + D



\(?\d\*\d\)? Coefficient part one
\*  connects the coefficient 
sin\(([^)\n]*)\) --sin and the middle gets us B and C
--second part after sin
